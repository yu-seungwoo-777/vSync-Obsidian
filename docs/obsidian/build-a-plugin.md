Build a plugin

Plugins let you extend Obsidian with your own features to create a custom note-taking experience.

In this tutorial, you'll compile a sample plugin from source code and load it into Obsidian.

What you'll learn 
After you've completed this tutorial, you'll be able to:

Configure an environment for developing Obsidian plugins.
Compile a plugin from source code.
Reload a plugin after making changes to it.
Prerequisites 
To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

Git installed on your local machine.
A local development environment for Node.js.
A code editor, such as Visual Studio Code.
Before you start 
When developing plugins, one mistake can lead to unintended changes to your vault. To prevent data loss, you should never develop plugins in your main vault. Always use a separate vault dedicated to plugin development.

Create an empty vault.

Step 1: Download the sample plugin 
In this step, you'll download a sample plugin to the plugins directory in your vault's .obsidian directory so that Obsidian can find it.

The sample plugin you'll use in this tutorial is available in a GitHub repository.

Open a terminal window and change the project directory to the plugins directory.
cd path/to/vault
mkdir .obsidian/plugins
cd .obsidian/plugins
Clone the sample plugin using Git.
git clone https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin.git
GitHub template repository
The repository for the sample plugin is a GitHub template repository, which means you can create your own repository from the sample plugin. To learn how, refer to Creating a repository from a template.

Remember to use the URL of your own repository when cloning the sample plugin.

Step 2: Build the plugin 
In this step, you'll compile the sample plugin so that Obsidian can load it.

Navigate to the plugin directory.
cd obsidian-sample-plugin
Install dependencies.
npm install
Compile the source code. The following command keeps running in the terminal and rebuilds the plugin when you modify the source code.
npm run dev
Notice that the plugin directory now has a main.js file that contains a compiled version of the plugin.

Step 3: Enable the plugin 
To load a plugin in Obsidian, you first need to enable it.

In Obsidian, open Settings.
In the side menu, select Community plugins.
Select Turn on community plugins.
Under Installed plugins, enable the Sample Plugin by selecting the toggle button next to it.
You're now ready to use the plugin in Obsidian. Next, we'll make some changes to the plugin.

Step 4: Update the plugin manifest 
In this step, you'll rename the plugin by updating the plugin manifest, manifest.json. The manifest contains information about your plugin, such as its name and description.

Open manifest.json in your code editor.
Change id to a unique identifier, such as "hello-world".
Change name to a human-friendly name, such as "Hello world".
Rename the plugin folder to match the plugin's id.
Restart Obsidian to load the new changes to the plugin manifest.
Go back to Installed plugins and notice that the name of the plugin has been updated to reflect the changes you made.

Remember to restart Obsidian whenever you make changes to manifest.json.

Step 5: Update the source code 
To let the user interact with your plugin, add a ribbon icon that greets the user when they select it.

Open main.ts in your code editor.
Rename the plugin class from MyPlugin to HelloWorldPlugin.
Import Notice from the obsidian package (if it hasn't been imported already).
import { Notice, Plugin } from 'obsidian';
In the onload() method, add the following code:
this.addRibbonIcon('dice', 'Greet', () => {
  new Notice('Hello, world!');
});
In the Command palette, select Reload app without saving to reload the plugin.
You can now see a dice icon in the ribbon on the left side of the Obsidian window. Select it to display a message in the upper-right corner.

Remember, you need to reload your plugin after changing the source code, either by disabling it then enabling it again in the community plugins panel, or using the command palette as detailed in part 5 of this step.

Hot reloading
Install the Hot-Reload plugin to automatically reload your plugin while developing.

Conclusion 
In this tutorial, you've built your first Obsidian plugin using the TypeScript API. You've modified the plugin and reloaded it to reflect the changes inside Obsidian.
